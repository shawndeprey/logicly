      <h3>What is the Idea Base?</h3>
      <p>
        The Idea Base is an encyclopedia-like, user-maintained database of ideas you want to 
        discuss. Whether that idea is a controversial theory or an interesting question, 
        anything is open for discussion.

      <h3>What is the Link Base?</h3>
      <p>
        The Link Base is a database of user-submitted links to any page around the web you want
        to discuss. Whether that link is a YouTube video with disabled ratings and comments or 
        a controversial tweet, anything is open for discussion.

      <h3>What is the Discussion Platform?</h3>
      <p>
        The discussion platform is a place where you can submit comments and vote on the best 
        ones for or against a topic.
        <br /><br />
        The power of Logicly's platform comes from our focus on opposing viewpoints. You're able 
        to view both sides of an argument side-by-side, deciding which opinions are the best. The 
        most popular opinions in each viewpoint rise to the top.
